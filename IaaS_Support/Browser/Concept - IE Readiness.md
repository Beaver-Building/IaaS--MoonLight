Protected mode:

Protected mode uses the windows vista integrity mechanism to run the internet explorer process at low integrity. The main features of the integrity level mechanism is follows:

Securable objects, such as files and registry keys, have security descriptors that define the integrity level or level of privilege required for write access to the object.

Processes have an integrity level defined in the security access token. In protected Mode, Internet explorer has a low integrity level. Applications run from the start menu have a medium integrity level. Application that require administrator permissions run with a high integrity level.

Low integrity processes cannot gain write access to objects at higher integrity level

Low integrity process cannot gain write access to objects at higher integrity levels, even if the user's SID is granted write access in the discretionary access control. Integrity level checks are performed before user access permission checks/

Low integrity:

Temporary Internet Files folder

The history folder

The Cookies folder

The Favorites folder

The Windows temporary file folders

Enhanced protected mode:

Disable incompatible add-ons.
