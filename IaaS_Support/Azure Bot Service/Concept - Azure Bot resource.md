# Azure Bot resource
   

You can think of the new Azure Bot resource as equivalent of the bot channels registration.  It has the same functionality.  Docs should reflect the underlying behavior of both, and should be updated to reflect the nuanced changes in the portal experience.

The basic difference is the new Azure Bot resource now comes with the “open in composer” UI in the Azure blade, helping customers more easily get started creating their bot resource.
